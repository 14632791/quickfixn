We've made three QuickFIX/N example applications:

1. The [Simple Acceptor][0] is a barebones acceptor that prints any message
   it receives to the console.
2. The [Trade Client][1] is a command-line client that sends order messages.
3. The [Executor][2] listens for order messages and responds with mock
   execution responses.

The Trade Client and Executor can be configured to send and execute
orders with each other.

Have your own app you'd like to share?  [Contact us!][3]
